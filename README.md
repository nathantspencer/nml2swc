You might know `.nml` files from your favorite online skeletonizing application: webKnossos. You might have pockets full of `.zip` files of raw image data from your tracings. On the other hand, you might not know what to do with them. Look no further! This toolkit contains several tools to manipulate and make use of `.nml` and `.zip` files directly from webKnossos, as well as file types like `.swc` and `.hoc` that can be created from webKnossos files.

# **nml_tools**

## nml_merger
> The python script `nml_merger.py` takes multiple `.nml` files and merges them into one master file containing the skeleton data of all of its components. The resulting `.nml` can be uploaded to webKnossos and viewed as one skeleton. The script takes as arguments first the directory containing the files to be merged, and then the full path to the output file.

> **EX:** `$ python nml_merger.py 'path\to\nml\directory' 'path\to\output.nml'`

> Compatability with Knossos files is a known limitation of this script. As it stands, it is only capable of merging files from WebKnossos. The file format of Knossos files is slightly different and is not yet accounted for. Knossos files will be skipped and display a warning message, but will not terminate the merging process.

## nml_splitter
> The python script `nml_splitter.py` takes an `.nml` file or a directory containing `.nml` files as an argument and splits them into multiple skeletons. Each `<thing>` in the file will become its own `.nml`, with branchpoints and comments preserved.  Output files will retain their original file name with a numbering appended, e.g. `output.nml` will become `output_1.nml`, `output_2.nml`, etc. Usage examples are shown below.

> **EX:** `$ python nml_splitter.py 'path\to\master.nml'`

> **EX:** `$ python nml_splitter.py 'path\to\nml\directory'`

## nml2swc
> The python script `nml2swc.py` can be used to convert all `.nml` files in a directory into `.swc` files with a given radius. The script takes one or two arguments: the full path to the file or directory containing your `.nml`s, and the optional integer radius you'd like to assign to each node of the resulting `.swc`s. If the second argument is left out, radii for each node of the skeleton will be taken from the input `.nml`. Usage examples are shown below.

> **EX:** `$ python nml2swc.py 'path\to\nml\directory' 15`

> **EX:** `$ python nml2swc.py 'path\to\nml\file.nml'`

> Note that in the second usage example, the radius for each node will be taken from the `.nml` file given as the first argument because no second argument was given.

# **swc_tools**

## swc2hoc
> The python script `swc2hoc.py` takes as an argument the path to an `.swc` file representing a dendrite and an `.swc` file representing a soma. A `.hoc` file will be created in the same directory as the `.swc` file along with a commented version with `_commented` appended to its name. A usage example is given below.

> **EX:** `$ python swc2hoc.py 'dendriteSkeleton.swc' 'somaSkeleton.swc'`

> The commented version of the `.hoc` will include comments according to the branch number for each branch order. For example, a section labeled `// d1` is the first branch. A section labeled `// d1,2` is the second of the branches descending from the first branch. A section labeled `// d2,1,3` is the third branch descending from the first branch descending from the second branch.

## swc2obj
> The python script `swc2obj.py` will convert a given `.swc` into a point cloud `.obj` file for viewing in MeshLab, Blender, and other similar tools. It takes as an argument the full path to the `.swc` file of interest or to a directory containing `.swc` files, and places the resulting `.obj` file(s) alongisde the input file in its parent directory. Usage examples are given below.

> **EX:** `$ python swc2obj.py 'path\to\swc\file.swc'`

> **EX:** `$ python swc2obj.py 'path\to\swc\directory'`

> Following the command given in the first example, `file.obj` will be created in the same directory as the input file. In the second example, `.obj`s will be created in `\directory`.

## swc2pt3dadd
> The python script `swc2pt3dadd.py` will convert each node of a given `.swc` file into a 3d point which can then be pasted into a `.hoc` file. The script takes a path to the `.swc` file as an argument. The resulting file is not actually valid `.hoc` but rather a series of commands that can be used in a `.hoc` file. For this reason, the output file is saved as a `.txt` file alongside the input file with the suffix `_pt3dadd` appended to the original name. A usage example is shown below.

> **EX:** `$ python swc2pt3dadd.py 'path\to\swc\file.swc'`

## swc_center
> The python script `swc_center.py` takes as an argument the path to an `swc` file. An `.swc` will be created in the same directory as the target file, with `_centered` appended to the original file name. The new swc will be centered around (0, 0, 0). Note that this will result in negative coordinates. A usage example is shown below:

> **EX:** `$ python swc_center 'path\to\swc\file.swc'`

## swc_components
> The script `swc_components.py` takes an `.swc` file containing multiple root nodes and changes the type associated with each connected component so that they can be seen in different colors when visualized with an `swc` viewer such as [Shark Viewer](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/SharkViewer). If there is a loop in the `swc` (a connected component which has no root node), it will not be included in the resulting file.

> **EX:** `$ python swc_components.py 'path\to\swc\file.swc'`

> A file with the original name along with the suffix `_components` appended will be created in the source directory.

## swc_corrector
> The python script `swc_corrector.py` takes an `.swc` file as an argument and provides a copy of that file such that the indices of each node are presented as consecutive natural numbers. A usage example is shown below.

> **EX:** `$ python swc_corrector.py 'path\to\swc\file.swc'`

> Following execution of the script, a file will be created in the same directory as the original `.swc` and will have the same name with `_corrected` appended. This file should represent the same graphical structure, changing only the indices associated with each node.

## swc_cyclebreaker
> he python script `swc_cyclebreaker.py` takes an `.swc` file without any root node (i.e. a graph with only one connected component which contains a loop). The node that should be made the root node should be indicated by setting its type to 1. An adjacency list will be created for the graph, from which a new graph will be drawn using the indicated node as the new root. The cycle in the graph will be eliminated. A usage example is given below.

> **EX:** `$ python swc_cyclebreaker.py 'path\to\swc\file.swc'`

> The redrawn `.swc` will be saved alongside the source file with the suffix `_cyclebroken` appended to its name. 

## swc_smoother
> The script `swc_smoother.py` is a work in progress and may not terminate properly for some values of allowable change per node. Give the path to an `swc` file and a float maximum allowable change per node, the script will smooth over abrupt changes in radius from node to node, capping the maximum change between two nodes such that radius changes are smoother and less jumpy.

> **EX:** `$ python swc_smoother 'path\to\swc\file.swc' 1.1`

> In this example, the radius change between two nodes will be restricted to be no more than 10%. The resulting "smoothed" `swc` will be saved alongside the source file with the suffix `_smooth` appended to its name.

## swc_offset
> The script `swc_offset.py` takes as arguments the path to an `.swc` file and three `float` offsets for the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and z-coordinate respectively. These offsets are added to the original coordinates. They may be negative. The resulting offset `.swc` is saved alongside the input file with the suffix `_offset` appended to the name. A usage example is given below:

> **EX:** `$ python swc_offset 'path\to\swc\file.swc' 150.25 23.4 -87.64`

# **hoc_tools**

## hoc_scaler
> The python script `hoc_scaler.py` can be used to apply scale factors to the x, y, and z coordinates of a `.hoc` file as well as to the diameter of a node. It takes five arguments: the path to the `.hoc` file, the x scale factor, the y scale factor, the z scale factor, and the diameter scale factor, respectively. A usage example is shown below. 

> **EX:** `$ python hoc_scaler.py 'path\to\hoc\file.hoc' 1.5 1.5 1.5 0.015`

> Once the script has finished executing, a `.hoc` file with `_scaled` appended to the original name will be created in the same directory as the input file.

# **zip_tools**

## zip_splitter
> The MATLAB script `zip_splitter.m` can be used to take a webKnossos `.zip` containing multiple cells and split it into multiple files corresponding to each cell. The `.zip` should be placed in `/zip_splitter`. The output files will be created in this directory as well. A usage example is shown below.

> **EX:** `zip_splitter('multi_cells.zip')`

> The output files will be named `multi_cells_part1.zip`, `multi_cells_part2.zip`, etc. The number at the end of the ouput file corresponds to the cell number used in webKnossos.
